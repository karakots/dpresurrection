Ad inventory in the same vehicle is often available from both the publisher of the vehicle and one or more ad networks.  Ad networks usually make it easier to buy across many vehicles, though the ad buyer often gives up some control over the specific placement of ads."

This can include time (the length of a radio or TV ad), space (the size of the ad), color versus black & white, and animated versus a static image.

It is generally believed that a consumer can not purchase a brand/product until that consumer is aware of the product.

Pulsed Advertising,"Ads are presented in time in groups, with time between each group.  This allows a limited ad budget to be maintained over an entire campaign, while achieving a minimum level of advertising while ads are ""turned on.""  This practice is based on the belief that to low a level of advertising will influence no one, and by pulsing a campaign the advertiser will be able to influence consumers at least during the pulse.  It has also been shown that consumers influenced during the pulse will still be influenced during the gaps, though at a decreased rate as the gap length increases."

Recency,"Recency describes how close to the time of purchase an ad occurs.  Higher recency ads occur closer to the time of purchase.  Because the awareness and persuasion effects of an ad exposure decay with time, an ad with higher recency has more influence on purchase than an ad with lower recency, given the same level of awareness and persuasion for both of the ads.  There is a tradeoff among recency, awareness, and persuasion (as well as reach and other factors influencing media effectiveness) among different media types, so the medium with the most recency is not necessarily the most persuasive."
