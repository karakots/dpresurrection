How does AdPlanit work to test and improve my plan?,"AdPlanit has a unique way to test and improve your media plans.

AdPlanit will tell you which combination of choices you’ve made is most likely to meet your advertising goals. "
What’s the difference between a campaign and a plan?,"A campaign defines the budget, customer characteristics and marketing objectives for advertising program.   A plan is the actual collection of media (TV, Newspaper, internet) and their characteristics (size, timing, cost) that comprise a campaign.

What if I don’t know my customer segments?,"With AdPlanit, you can start by simply selecting the geography in which you want to advertise.

What if I don’t know how to time my media?,"There are many decisions to make in crafting a media plan, including the timing of your advertisements.  Timing itself has many variables.  For radio, as an example, timing includes the “daypart”, as well as the length of ads and number of ads per day.    Furthermore, you might “pulse” your advertising, having it on one week and off another week, to help stretch you advertising budget.   And, you might spend more heavily in some seasons than others.<br><br>The simplest way to deal with all this complexity is with a single click that asks AdPlanit to generate a plan for you.  AdPlanit handles all the choices for timing, as well as choices regarding allocating your money across media types and selecting specific vehicles within a media type.<br><br>If you have a plan already, a media editor allows you to enter this plan and simulate it, resulting in a rating of your plan’s performance on timing, as well as other factors important to your campaign.  You can use this feedback to improve your plan, even if you don’t have any experience in media planning."
Can AdPlanit suggest an initial media plan? ,Yes.

"If I have a small budget, will AdPlanit still work? ","Yes, but certain media types require a minimum investment to be effective.   For example, a single radio advertisement is not very effective – at a minimum, you’d want to reach your prospective customers more than once to achieve a minimal goal of awareness."
Can an ad agency use AdPlanit?,"Ad agencies have three main functions: media planning, media buying and creating the ads.<br><br>If your agency specializes in the creative area, then AdPlanit can help you work with your clients to optimally allocate their budget among media and creative, and to implement a campaign that uses the right media for the creative and vice-versa.<br><br>If your agency focuses on media buying, AdPlanit can provide a way to evaluate tradeoffs between the optimal plan and the inventory that is available.  For agencies focusing on media planning, the simulation engine provides unique insights into plan effectiveness, especially the interaction of multiple media types and various timing alternatives."

National and global enterprises allocating significant advertising dollars at the local level will find AdPlanit a powerful way to get the best return on this investment."
How should I implement my plan with my media providers?,"AdPlanit allows you to create a great plan for your advertising campaign.  Next, you can implement the plan yourself by contacting media providers directly or by contacting a media buying service who can do it for you.   AdPlanit gives you have the option of printing your shopping list or creating traditional advertising requests for proposals (RFPs).
