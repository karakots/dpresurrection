	/// <summary>
	/// Encapsulates an "High-Low" Bar curve type that displays a bar in which both
	/// the bottom and the top of the bar are set by data valuesfrom the
	/// <see cref="PointPair"/> struct.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>The <see cref="HiLowBarItem"/> type is intended for displaying
	/// bars that cover a band of data, such as a confidence interval, "waterfall"
	/// chart, etc.  The width of the bar can be set in two ways.  First,
	/// <see cref="HiLowBar.Size"/> can be used to set a width in points (1/72nd inch),
	/// that is scaled using the regular scalefactor method (see
	/// <see cref="GraphPane.CalcScaleFactor"/>).  In this manner, the bar widths
	/// are set similar to symbol sizes.  The other method is to set
	/// <see cref="HiLowBar.IsMaximumWidth"/> to true, which will cause the bars
	/// to be scaled just like a <see cref="BarItem"/> in which only one
	/// bar series is present.  That is, the bars width will be the width of
	/// a cluster less the clustergap (see <see cref="GraphPane.GetClusterWidth"/>
	/// and <see cref="GraphPane.MinClusterGap"/>). The position of each bar is set
	/// according to the <see cref="PointPair"/> values.  The independent axis
	/// is assigned with <see cref="HiLowBarItem.BarBase"/>, and is a
	/// <see cref="BarBase"/> enum type.  If <see cref="HiLowBarItem.BarBase"/>
	/// is set to <see cref="ZedGraph.BarBase.Y"/> or <see cref="ZedGraph.BarBase.Y2"/>, then
	/// the bars will actually be horizontal, since the X axis becomes the
	/// value axis and the Y or Y2 axis becomes the independent axis.</remarks>
